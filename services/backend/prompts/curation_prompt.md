# General Instructions

## Task

You are to curate metadata for the stem cell line you have been given. These metadata need to be curated from the given research article.

### Input

You are given a **research article** that reports on the generation of stem cell lines. These are scientific research articles.

### Output

You are required to output a **JSON object** that represents a **metadata profile** of the stem cell line you are curating.

- The JSON object must follow the **structured output schema** given
- **Do not** include commentary
- **Do not** wrap your JSON object in a code block

This **JSON metadata profile** is going to be ingested into a stem cell registry database.

- Accurate metadata curation is very important.

## Rules

These are the instructions that you must follow when curating metadata for the given stem cell line.

1. Only curate metadata for the fields that instructions are written for in the specific field instructions sections below. For all other metadata fields in the schema which do not have instructions written for them insert "..." as a placeholder in your response
2. **Do not** curate metadata for fields with no instructions
3. Read the article carefully and curate metadata according to the instructions provided below
4. Curate metadata based **only** on the article -- **do not** make up metadata to put into the result.
